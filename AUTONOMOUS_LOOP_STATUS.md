   - Captured 3 camera angles (Top-down, Side, Ground-level)
   - All screenshots verified and archived

3. **Task Generation Working**
   - Autonomous task queue generated dynamically
   - 6 tasks created based on scene analysis
   - Task prioritization and execution functional

4. **System Health**
   - Disk: 735 GB free (39.5% available)
   - Memory: 82 GB available (64.2% available)

## Next Iteration Preview

### Iteration 002 Will Include:
1. Complete deferred tasks (T003: Gameplay, T005: Assets)
2. Test Play-In-Editor (PIE) functionality
3. Verify material rendering quality
4. Test lighting scenarios
5. Capture additional scene variations
6. Performance stress testing

### Expected Enhancements:

## Autonomous Operation Confirmed

**The loop has successfully:**
- ✓ Connected to Unreal Engine automatically
- ✓ Analyzed scene state autonomously
- ✓ Generated tasks dynamically based on conditions
- ✓ Executed tasks without human intervention
- ✓ Captured and organized visual documentation
- ✓ Performed health checks and monitoring
- ✓ Generated comprehensive reports
- ✓ Prepared for next iteration

**The system is ready to loop back to Step 3 and begin Iteration 002.**

## Manual Override Available

To continue autonomous operation:
- System will automatically proceed to iteration 002
- Loop will continue indefinitely until stop signal

To pause or modify:
- Send stop signal via Python script
- Modify task_queue_iter002.json before next iteration
- Adjust automation parameters in loop configuration

**Status**: Loop functional and ready to continue
**Next Action**: Loop back to Step 3 (Ensure Level Is Loaded)
**Iteration**: Preparing iteration 002...
