# Product Overview

## Alexander - VR Space Farming Game

Alexander is an ambitious VR space simulation game inspired by Star Citizen, featuring:

- **VR-First Design**: Built for immersive VR experiences with hand tracking and motion controls
- **Space Flight Simulation**: 6DOF Newtonian physics with realistic cockpit controls
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Revolutionary AI Vision System that autonomously improves the game by analyzing screenshots
- **Space Farming**: Unique farming mechanics in space environments
- **Multi-Platform**: Targeting VisionOS, Windows, Android, and other VR platforms

## Core Vision

The project pioneers AI-assisted game development where an AI system:

1. Captures screenshots of the game in real-time
2. Analyzes visual quality and gameplay elements using computer vision
3. Generates and executes code improvements automatically
4. Iterates toward development goals autonomously

## Target Experience

Players will experience a detailed VR spaceship cockpit with interactive controls, realistic space flight physics, and the ability to land on planets to establish and manage farming operations - all while maintaining the visual fidelity and attention to detail found in games like Star Citizen.
