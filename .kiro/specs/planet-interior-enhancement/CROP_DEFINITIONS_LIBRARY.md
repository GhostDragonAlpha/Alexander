## Implementation Notes

These crop definitions should be created as UDataAsset instances in the Unreal Editor:

- Path: `Content/Farming/Crops/`
- Asset naming: `DA_Crop_[CropName]`
- Example: `DA_Crop_Wheat`, `DA_Crop_Tomatoes`

Each data asset should be configured with the parameters specified above, and appropriate meshes/materials should be assigned for visual representation.
