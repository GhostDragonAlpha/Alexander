VERIFICATION REPORT: DEFENSIVE LOGGING CODE WITH ">>>" MARKERS
================================================================
Generated: 2025-11-06
Test Status: COMPILATION FAILED - MARKERS NOT LOADED

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
The defensive logging code with ">>>" markers IS PRESENT in the source code but
WAS NOT COMPILED into the running binary. The loaded DLL contains an older build
from before the source modifications were made.

4. RUNTIME LOG ANALYSIS
   
   Active Log File: c:\Users\allen\Desktop\Alexander\Alexander\Saved\Logs\Alexander.log
   Last Updated: 2025-11-07 05:46:26
   Total Lines: 3,528
   Execution Window: 2025.11.07 05:43:21 to 05:46:26
   
   Confirmed AutomationAPI Activity:
   [2025.11.07-05.43.54:150] AutomationAPI: Incoming connection from 127.0.0.1:49467
   [2025.11.07-05.43.54:150] AutomationAPI: HandleSubmitObservation RequestBody: '{"observer_id": 1, ...}'
   [2025.11.07-05.43.54:150] AutomationAPI: Stored observation 1 for target 1 from observer 1 (total: 1)
   [2025.11.07-05.43.54:150] AutomationAPI: POST /submit_observation - 0.07ms
   
   Defensive Logging Markers (>>>): NOT FOUND
   Search Result: 0 occurrences of ">>>" in entire log directory
   
   Critical Finding:
   - HandleSubmitObservation IS being called and executing
   - BUT the >>> defensive logging statements are NOT being output
   - The function is logging OTHER statements (RequestBody, Stored observation)
   - This proves the OLD code is running (pre->>> version)

5. TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTION
   
   2025-11-06 23:05:25 - AutomationAPIServer.cpp compiled for Editor
   2025-11-06 23:05:30 - UnrealEditor-Alexander.dll finalized
     ^ THIS DLL LACKS >>> MARKERS
   
   2025-11-06 23:17:03 - AutomationAPIServer.cpp modified (>>> markers added)
     ^ SOURCE CODE UPDATED, but DLL not rebuilt
   
   2025-11-06 23:17:51 - AutomationAPIServer.cpp compiled for packaged game
   2025-11-06 23:18:00 - Alexander.exe packaged
   
   2025-11-07 05:43:54 - HandleSubmitObservation called in packaged game
     ^ NO >>> MARKERS LOGGED - proves old DLL code is executing

6. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
   
   Problem: Source code has >>> markers but compiled binary does not contain them
   
   Reason 1 - DLL Not Rebuilt:
   The UnrealEditor-Alexander.dll was compiled at 23:05:30, which is 12 minutes
   BEFORE the source code was modified at 23:17:03 to add the >>> markers. The
   DLL was never recompiled to include the new logging code.
   
   Reason 2 - Old Binary Still Loaded:
   The game is executing code from the old DLL that was built before the >>>
   markers were added to the source. The .obj files show mixed timestamps,
   suggesting incomplete rebuild.
   
   Reason 3 - Cache or Build System Issue:
   The game executable (Alexander.exe) appears to be using the pre->>> DLL,
   even though it was built later. This could be due to:
   - DLL caching/not being replaced
   - Linker using old cached binaries
   - Incomplete dependency tracking during build

7. EVIDENCE SUMMARY
   
   Source Code: CONTAINS >>> MARKERS (19 instances)
   - File: AutomationAPIServer.cpp
   - Modified: 2025-11-06 23:17:03
   - Lines with >>>: 871, 874, 878, 881, 884, 902, 906, 915, 919, 921, 924, 926, 929, 931, 937, 943, 945, 947, 949
   
   Compiled DLL: LACKS >>> MARKERS (0 occurrences in logs)
   - File: UnrealEditor-Alexander.dll
   - Built: 2025-11-06 23:05:30 (BEFORE source modification)
   - Size: 12,075,008 bytes
   
   Runtime Execution: OLD CODE RUNNING (no >>> markers logged)
   - Log file shows HandleSubmitObservation called
   - Log shows non->>> statements being logged
   - Log shows NO >>> defensive logging markers
   - This proves old binary is executing

VERIFICATION RESULT
===================

Status: FAILED - Defensive Logging Code NOT Compiled or Loaded

The defensive logging code with ">>>" markers exists in the source code but was
NOT successfully compiled into the production binaries. The running code is from
an old build that predates the source modifications.

REQUIRED ACTIONS
================

To verify >>> markers are compiled and working:

1. FULL REBUILD REQUIRED:
   - Delete: c:\Users\allen\Desktop\Alexander\Alexander\Intermediate\
   - Delete: c:\Users\allen\Desktop\Alexander\Alexander\Binaries\
   - Perform: Clean Rebuild of entire project

2. FORCE RECOMPILATION:
   - Modify a comment in AutomationAPIServer.cpp to touch the file
   - Force the build system to recompile the module
   - Verify new .obj timestamp is AFTER 2025-11-06 23:17:03

3. VERIFY IN LOGS:
   - Run the game after rebuild
   - Look for ">>>" markers in Saved\Logs\Alexander.log
   - Confirm all 19 defensive logging statements appear

4. ALTERNATIVE QUICK CHECK:
   - Recompile just the AutomationAPIServer module
   - Use: Compile -> Compile AutomationAPIServer

Current Status Summary:
- Source Code: Has >>> markers (✓)
- Compilation: Failed to include >>> markers (✗)
- Runtime Execution: Old code without >>> markers (✗)
- Overall Verification: FAILED (✗)

Recommendation: Perform a full clean rebuild to ensure defensive logging is
properly compiled and loaded into the binary.
