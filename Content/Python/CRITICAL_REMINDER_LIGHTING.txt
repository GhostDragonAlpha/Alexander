  ⚠️  CRITICAL: ALWAYS TRIGGER BUILD AFTER LIGHTING CHANGES!
================================================================================

WHENEVER you modify lighting in Unreal Engine, you MUST:

1. Execute: trigger_lighting_build.py via remote connection
2. Wait 10-30 seconds for build to complete
3. Then capture screenshots

WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
- Unreal doesn't automatically update lighting
- Changes to lights, materials, or scene require rebuild
- Without rebuild = black screen, errors, or no changes visible

================================================================================
  📋 LIGHTING CHANGE CHECKLIST
================================================================================

□ Made lighting changes (lights, materials, mobility)
□ Executed: trigger_lighting_build.py
□ Waited for build completion (check editor for progress)
□ Refreshed viewport
□ THEN captured screenshots

================================================================================
  🔧 COMMON LIGHTING ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

Issue: "Too many overlapping movable lights"
Solution:
  - Limit to 4-5 movable lights per area
  - Set SkyLights to STATIC (they don't count!)
  - Remove excess fill lights

Issue: Black screenshots
Solution:
  - Check XR/VR mode (exit with Alt+P)
  - Trigger lighting build
  - Check viewport show flags (viewmode lit)
  - Verify materials are assigned

Issue: Swarm initialization failure
Solution:
  - Use MOVABLE lights (no Swarm needed)
  - SkyLights can be STATIC without Swarm

  🎯 FINAL LIGHTING SETUP (AI VISION TEST ARENA)
================================================================================

MOVABLE LIGHTS (4 total - under limit):
  • Star_Dynamic: 500,000 (point light at 2000,0,1000)
  • Cockpit_Light_Front: 100,000
  • Cockpit_Light_Above: 100,000
  • Cockpit_Fill_Direct: 100,000

STATIC LIGHTS (don't count towards limit):
  • Starlight_Ambient: 10.0 (SkyLight - STATIC!)

MATERIALS:
  • All objects: DefaultMaterial (white/gray)
