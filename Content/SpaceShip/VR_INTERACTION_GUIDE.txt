# VR INTERACTION SETUP GUIDE

## Components Created:
✅ FlightStick - Left hand control (physics enabled)
✅ Throttle - Right hand control (physics enabled)  
✅ VR_CameraPosition - Player head reference
✅ Cockpit geometry - Seats, panels, displays

## Next Steps for Full VR:

### 1. VR Pawn Setup (BP_VRSpaceshipPlayer)
- Add VROrigin (Scene Component)
- Add Camera (under VROrigin) at eye level
- Add MotionController_Left with:
  - GrabComponent or PhysicsHandle
  - Hand mesh/visualization
- Add MotionController_Right with:
  - GrabComponent or PhysicsHandle  
  - Hand mesh/visualization

### 2. Input Mapping
Create Input Actions for:
- Grab_Left (Trigger on left controller)
- Grab_Right (Trigger on right controller)
- Release (Release triggers)

### 3. Grab Logic
In motion controller blueprints:
- On Grab: Line trace from controller
- If hit FlightStick/Throttle: Attach to hand
- While grabbed: Apply forces based on hand movement
- On Release: Detach from hand

### 4. Flight Control Integration
Map hand positions to flight controls:
- FlightStick position → Pitch/Roll
- Throttle position → Forward/Backward thrust
- Button presses → Systems (lights, shields, etc.)

### 5. Testing in VR
- Set BP_VRSpaceshipPlayer as default pawn
- PIE (Play In Editor) with VR headset
- Test grabbing and moving controls
- Adjust physics damping for feel

## Current Status:
✅ Cockpit geometry built
✅ Physics enabled on interactive objects
✅ VR pawn blueprint created
⏳ Need to configure motion controllers and grab logic
⏳ Need input mappings
⏳ Need to connect to flight physics

## Files to Edit:
- /Game/SpaceShip/Blueprints/BP_VRSpaceshipPlayer
- Project Settings → Input → Action Mappings
- Create BP_FlightController for physics simulation
